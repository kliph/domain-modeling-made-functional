* Preface
The book recommends using F#, but I'd prefer to use Clojure.  I suspect that I'll need some flavor of typing.  We'll see how far I get with plain old Clojure before introducing [[http://typedclojure.org/][one of the Clojure Type]] ([[https://clojure.org/guides/spec][or type-like]]) systems.

A so-called "algebraic" approach to functional domain modeling.
*** Bounded Context
**** A consistent vocabulary
**** Set of behaviors
